project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app with typescript`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd project-name/
    yarn start (npm run start)
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/*`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`/public`**: This directory will contain our static files

4.  **`/.env`**: This file will contain environment variables. Always need to be in .gitignore [About env](https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa).

9.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for prettier. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

10. **`CODING-GUIDELINE`**: This is a file for our code style.

11. **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.lock.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
